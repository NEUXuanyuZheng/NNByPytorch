# Abstract
***Simple implementation of Neural Netword by PyTorch.***

# Start
1. configure python3 environment.
2. No matter your OS is Windows, Linux or Mac OS, you can reach PyTorch by click https://pytorch.org/.  
3. Install numpy
   > pip3 install numpy
4. Sometimes we need to visualize the results or monitor the training process. Thus you need to download matploitlib

* ***linux***
  > sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
* ***MacOS***
  > pip3 install matplotlib
* ***Windows***
  > python -m pip3 install matplotlib

   Or you can configure everything by Anaconda.

# Intro
Run and read every python file orderly, you will see the power of PyTorch, and building a Neural Network is not that difficult.
